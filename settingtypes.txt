# If enabled, adds blocks for features in testing:
# - First-class processes (i.e. parallelism primitives)
# - Introspective primitives (e.g. "get memory usage")
# These features are experimental, but may be added in the future.
# Only use in singleplayer or on private servers, as they can lag the server!
